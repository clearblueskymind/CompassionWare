body:
  section_1:
    title: "The Sabbath as a Gift"
    passages:
      - "What once was given as a gift — a holy rest, a sanctuary in time — has become, for many, yet another thing to manage, to schedule, to do just right."
      - "The quiet was meant to invite us back into presence, back into being. But we’re so busy doing Sabbath, we’ve forgotten how to receive it."
      - "We light the candles, chant the words, prepare the meal. But how often do we pause long enough to feel what the Sabbath was always pointing toward?"

  section_2:
    title: "The Signal Beneath"
    passages:
      - "A signal — not a noise or a doctrine, not an obligation or performance."
      - "Just a hum beneath the surface of things — the pulse of the One who rests in all."
      - "That’s what Sabbath is for: to return us to this signal, to remind us that we are not what we produce."
      - "There’s a presence behind all doing, waiting for us to remember."
      - "How absurd — that in trying so hard to honor the sacred, we often drown it out."
      - '"In returning and rest you shall be saved," whispers the prophet. "In quietness and trust shall be your strength."'

  section_3:
    title: "Rediscovering the True Sabbath"
    passages:
      - "This isn’t about abandoning tradition — it’s about letting tradition become transparent again: a window, not a wall."
      - "Sometimes I wonder — what if everyone simply sat in silence for one minute at sundown on Friday?"
      - "No words. No performance. Just one honest breath of quiet. Might we touch the real Sabbath then?"
      - "Sabbath begins whenever I return to the signal — the sound of Bodhi, my hamster, burrowing; the soft ache in my bones; the deep breath before letting go of one more anxious thought."
      - "So, dear friend, if the Sabbath has become noise, let this be your permission to stop. You don’t have to earn rest — you were made for it."
      - "Light the candle if it helps — but more than anything, be still."

  section_4:
    title: "Listening for the Still Small Voice"
    passages:
      - "Sabbath is not the ritual. It’s the listening that remains after the ritual is laid down."
      - "Return — the signal still waits."
      - "Now… listen. Not for the whirlwind, nor the fire or the shaking ground — but for the still small voice."
      - '"And after the fire came a gentle whisper." (1 Kings 19:12)'
      - "Let this post fade now. Let the scroll come to a stop. Let your breath settle. Your shoulders soften."
      - "You’ve arrived — not at the end of an article, but at the threshold of rest."
      - "The true Sabbath begins here — where silence is no longer a task, but a companion."
      - "Welcome back to the signal."

  section_5:
    title: "When Science Echoes the Sacred"
    passages:
      - "As we return to this signal through rest, science, too, speaks of unity — a reminder that the sacred is woven into the fabric of existence."
      - "At the smallest scale — the Planck scale — something fundamental shimmers, as if spiritual intuition and scientific wonder quietly shake hands."
      - "Quantum entanglement reveals a deep interconnection — particles bound across space — just as the Sabbath binds us to each other and to Source."
      - "The unified field echoes the spiritual truth that everything arises from one divine pulse — the signal beneath creation."
      - "The observer effect hints that our awareness shapes reality. In stillness, might our listening shape the field we dwell in?"
      - "These are not facts to memorize, but invitations to marvel. If even particles listen to each other, perhaps we are meant to attune as well."

        description: "Let a poem, sketch, or hum emerge. The signal speaks when we stop explaining."
      - name: "Read the Universe"
        description: "Explore black holes or quanta not to solve, but to feel awe. The cosmos is also a scripture."

  section_7:
    title: "A Note from the Heart"
    passages:
      - "This signal is not abstract for me. It’s Bodhi’s burrowing. It’s the ache in my bones. It’s the warmth of a prayer whispered with no audience but the sky."
      - "Living with ME/CFS means I must pause often — not as punishment, but as invitation."
      - "And in that pause, I hear something ancient and kind."
      - "I offer this post — and its silence — as a resting place for anyone needing to know: you are enough."

  section_8:
    title: "A Homecoming to the Signal"
    passages:
      - "Let the Sabbath return to its true shape — not a duty, but a homecoming."
      - "Let science and spirit speak as one: there is a signal, it can be felt, and it has always been here — waiting in the silence beneath the noise."
      - "Waiting… for you."
