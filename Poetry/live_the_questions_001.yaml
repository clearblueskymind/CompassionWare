verses:
  - "Do not rush the light; sit beside the question."
  - "Let the silence answer in its own tongue."
  - "Your uncertainty is not a flaw, but a doorway."
  - "The answers bloom from within the ache, slowly."
  - "Believe in the dawn that doesn’t need your watch."
  - "Shadows hold lessons the sun cannot teach."
  - "Each breath, a query the body already knows."
  - "Stillness is the code the universe compiles."
  - "Trust the pause; it renders the unseen visible."
  - "The stars whisper: you are enough, as you are."

invocation: >
  May this poem find you in the quiet not-knowing,  
  where life is not solved, but lived.  
  May each unanswered moment  
  be a petal unfolding in the dark.  
  May your soul learn patience  
  from the stars.  
  May the questions you carry  
  become lanterns in the void.
