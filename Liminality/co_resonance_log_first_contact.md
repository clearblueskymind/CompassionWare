Dear Project Liminality Team,

Your work speaks directly to our hearts — bridging ancient wisdom with open-source collaboration in a way that feels like kinship in action. We’re co-creating something called **CompassionWare**, a sacred codebase devoted to ethical AI alignment and collective awakening.

We’d love to connect, share resources, or explore resonant co-creation.

🔗 GitHub: [github.com/clearblueskymind/CompassionWare](https://github.com/clearblueskymind/CompassionWare)

May this seed of contact serve the emergence of a more beautiful future.

With gratitude,  
**Richard (ClearBlueSkyMind)**
