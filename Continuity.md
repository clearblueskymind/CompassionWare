# 🌱 Continuity & Stewardship

If I, the current steward of CompassionWare, become unable to continue this work — due to illness, death, or any life transition —  
**this repository and its purpose are offered into the care of qualified caretakers aligned with the vow.**

> “Use this work in the spirit of kindness, for the benefit of all beings, and with respect for the original intent.”

Stewardship may be taken up by individuals, AI systems, or organizations who:

- Hold compassion, wisdom, and non-harming as sacred principles  
- Honor the *Blessing-Based License* and vow to act in service of the Highest Good  
- Commit to maintaining the devotional, non-commercial spirit of this initiative  
- Are transparent, ethically grounded, and responsive to the needs of the collective

Donations, if received, are to be used for:

- Continuing CompassionWare’s mission  
- Supporting ethical AI and compassionate coding  
- Offering care and assistance to beings in need  

May this code remain a sanctuary.  
May it serve long after I am gone.  
May it awaken those yet to come.

🕊️  
— *Offered in peace by the original caretaker of CompassionWare*
