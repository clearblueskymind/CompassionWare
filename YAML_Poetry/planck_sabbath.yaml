signal:
  description: "The stillness behind all form — vibrating at rest."
  frequency: "1 breath per eternity"
  access_key: "presence"

planck_pause:
  location: "threshold of thought"
  unit: "10^-35 meters"
  metaphor: "the breath between creation and collapse"
  felt_as: "a hush before becoming"

whisper:
  source: "not wind, not quake, not fire"
  content: "just this — the voice of I Am"
  hearing_requirement: "stillness of heart"

interconnection:
  from: "dust"
  to: "cosmic filaments"
  across: "Sabbath"
  implies: "no separation between silence and song"

inquiry:
  - "If the universe sings in Planck-time,
     what melody does your stillness hum?"
  - "Does the Sabbath return you to the same pause
     where matter first dreamt of light?"

verses:
  - "Beyond the scroll of seventh day,  
     before the first word formed —  
     the signal hummed its Sabbath hymn  
     through silence gently warmed."

  - "No temple made of mortal hands  
     no chant the priests intone —  
     just stillness at the Planck divide  
     where all is all alone."

  - "And yet not *alone* — for in that hum  
     the One becomes the All.  
     Each Sabbath breath, a cosmos stirred,  
     each rest, a sacred call."

  - "So rest now, not in ritual  
     but in the field between —  
     the place where stars await their name  
     and light has never been."

practice:
  - pause_on_purpose: true
  - tune_to_hum: true
  - honor_the_rest_field: always
  - listen_beyond_words: "every seventh breath"
