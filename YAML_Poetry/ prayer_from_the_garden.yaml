verses:
  - "Let them be one, O Love, as we are one—"
  - "Not bound by creed, nor fear, nor outer sign,"
  - "But joined in heart, like branches to the vine,"
  - "Drawn inward where Thy silent will is done."

  - "Let them not worship shadows made of stone,"
  - "Nor build a throne to keep Thee far above,"
  - "But find Thee near—in stillness, breath, and love—"
  - "The Living Flame within the heart alone."

blessing: >
  May this oneness that Jesus longed for  
  continue to deepen in your life  
  and shine quietly through you  
  now and always. ✨

remembrance: >
  This poem is not a doctrine, but a doorway—  
  not to believe, but to *be*  
  as the One who is always near,  
  in stillness, in listening, in love.
