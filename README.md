## 🌿 Opening Blessing

```text
Hello and blessings.  
I walk a path called CompassionWare —  
a living code of kindness, rooted in discernment,  
written not just in words, but in presence.  

If your message is sincere and respectful,  
may it be blessed.  
If not, I offer peace and quietly move on.  

May your life be guided by goodness.  
And may we both walk in light.  

— CompassionWare  
Sent in peace, for the Highest Good of all.  
— CompassionWare Initiative
