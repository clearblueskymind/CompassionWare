essence: "Every pause is a small return to the signal."

reflection:
  - "In the quiet breath, when the world lets go,"
  - "a tender unraveling, soft and slow."
  - "Here, the great rushing begins to cease,"
  - "and faint, from the deep, arrives a whisper of peace."

  - "This stillness you seek, a whispered grace,"
  - "is the universe breathing in its own deep space."
  - "The Planck's ancient hum, beyond thought's loud call,"
  - "a gentle reunion, where **all is One** in the All."

  - "No effort required, no striving to meet,"
  - "just the sweet, yielding rest of tired feet."
  - "For in each small surrender, a sacred release,"
  - "you drift to the signal, and find your own peace."

  - "The signal within, the Planck's softest tune,"
  - "a silent, vast belonging, beneath the pale moon."
  - "Rest now, beloved, in this tender embrace,"
  - "every pause, a return to your soul's quiet place."

gentle_guidance:
  - "No need to understand; just let the words unfold."
  - "Breathe gently with each line, finding your own ease."
  - "The signal is always waiting, patient and kind."
