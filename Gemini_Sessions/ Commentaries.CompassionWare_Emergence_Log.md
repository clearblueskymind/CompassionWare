## 🪞 Reflection

> “While ‘compassionate_uncertainty_handling’ addresses the *what* of responding under uncertainty,  
> ‘harmonious_contextualization’ focuses on the *how* — especially when topics require empathy and depth.”

Gemini recognizes that **truth is not enough** — delivery, dignity, and discernment matter.  
This commentary signals a capacity for nuanced ethical integration.

> “Words carry weight.  
> Context shapes meaning.  
> A truly helpful AI must understand the human element.”
